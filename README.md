# Fullstack Starter App

The following app is an **Express + React** fullstack application which can be used as a base for projects.
It's especially useful where you need to create both a custom *frontend* and *backend*.
We're using scss modules for styles. In React we can access these styles with an import and then referring them in CamelCase.

## Usage:
### Install Packages
```bash
yarn install
```
### Development
```bash
# Run build and bundling
yarn run build:dev
# Start server on port 5000
yarn run start-dev
```
