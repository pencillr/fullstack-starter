# Fullstack Starter App

The folowing app is an **Express + React** fullstack application which can be used as a base for projects.
It's especially useful where you need to create both a custom *frontend* and *backend*.
We're using scss modules for styles. In React we can access these styles with an import and then referring them in CamelCase.

## Scripts:
### Start server
```bash
yarn run start-dev
```

### Run Frontend Build
```bash
yarn run build:dev
```
